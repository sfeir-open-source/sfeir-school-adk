Workshops are in directory `steps` :

- two directories per workshop :
  - one with a README.md with workshop steps and source file to complete
  - a second directory suffixed with `-solution` which contains source file with solutions.

## AI Assistant Configuration

This project includes Model Context Protocol (MCP) configurations for enhanced AI coding assistance:

- **OpenCode** - `opencode.json` (auto-detected)
- **Gemini CLI** - `.gemini-mcp.json`
- **GitHub Copilot** - `.copilot-mcp.json`

All configurations include the `chrome-dev-tools` MCP server for automated slide verification and testing.
